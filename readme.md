# Hacking/Customising the electronics of the Mitsubishi iMiev/Citroen C-Zero/Peugeot iOn
We used the electronics of a Citroen C-Zero to convert a class VW Bus T2 to electric. There were and are many challenges while adding an additional battery and stripping down the wiring, so I will try to collect everything  I discovered about the electronics in one place. Maybe it`s usefull for somebody else. 

Most information was found in forums and on github, some I found out myself. I will try to quote everything correctly.
